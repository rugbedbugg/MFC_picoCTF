In this challenge we are given a ``git`` file which supposedly has some previous previous actions done on it. We are tasked with finding out what changes were made in the file previously.

First we have to reinitlialize the git repository by using ```git init``` in the ```drop-in``` directory
Then we can easily check the git history by typing ```git log``` in the terminal
