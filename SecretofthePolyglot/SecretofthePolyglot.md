This is a relatively straight-forward challenge. It is mentioned that we need to open the file in fidderent formats in order to get all the parts of the flag
- One of the methods is obviously .pdf
- I tried UTF-8 but that didnt work
### Opening the file in (.pdf) format
This gives us the last part of the flag

### Opening the file in (.docx) format

Resizing the tiny image present at the centre gives us the first part of the flag

I tried to combine both of them together into a single word which turned out to be the correct flag
```picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_90974127}```
